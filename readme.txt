A WooCommerce Theme Featuring Elementor/Page-builder Support For additional pages / templates

== Description ==

Site is Custom Built, all Graphics belong to the developer and anyone who
is thinking of using this theme if you choose to do so. Should make sure
graphics are changed. All Graphics must be changed before using this site. The site is equiped
with powerfull plugins that make a great user experience. I would recommend hiring
a developer. Theme uses sass and code is well documented so it should not
be hard for any developer with a decent amount of knowledge of WooCommerce and
wordpress development to customize this theme further to the customers liking
 But all this theme needs in order to function is some minor tweeking
and the enabling of a payment gateway such as paypal or stripe. 
25% of the proceeds
generated from the selling of this theme are donated to charity.
